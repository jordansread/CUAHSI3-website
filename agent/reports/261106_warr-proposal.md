# Proposal: the Women Advancing River Research (WARR) lectures as cyberseminar items

Content task from audit A3g (org issue 108), 6 November 2026. **Nothing is applied: this is the proposal ("Propose, then apply", more than five items). Jordan approves, changes or refuses each part below.** Branch `content/cyberseminars-warr` (cut from the fork's main at 01e32c0); only `agent/` has changed so far.

## Why

The legacy site's six yearly WARR pages are the only recording archive it holds: 63 lectures, each with a date, a title linked to its YouTube video, and the speakers with their institutions. The new site has none of them (A3g, finding 1), although `warr-archive-cuahsi-2026` says CUAHSI took over the archive in 2026.

## Part 1. Add 63 items to `content/cyberseminars/` (new)

- **Source of every fact (C2):** the six legacy pages `/cyberseminars/<year>-women-advancing-river-research-lecture-series`, saved in the 6 November 2026 snapshot. Nothing else was used except for the two spelling fixes below.
- **Counts (denominators):** 63 lectures: 2021 11, 2022 11, 2023 11, 2024 11, 2025 11, 2026 8. 63 of 63 have a video id; 63 distinct ids; **63 of 63 answered 200** on YouTube's oEmbed (public, on the CUAHSI channel); **62 of 63** page titles equal YouTube's title (the 63rd is listed below). 118 speakers, **118 of 118 with an institution**. No video id is already in `content/` (0 duplicates, C4); 63 distinct slugs. Run through `npm run validate:content` in a trial: 88 cyberseminar files (25 existing + 63), 0 failures; the trial files were then removed.
- **File names** (C13: `YYYY-slug.md`): `2021-warr-<short title>.md`. Slugs `warr-YYYY-MM-<first words of the title>` (they drive identity, never change once published).
- **Fields:** `title` as on the page; `slug`; `series: Women Advancing River Research (WARR)`; `series_slug: women-advancing-river-research-lecture-series` (the legacy series address); `date` the lecture date on the page; `youtube_id`; `speakers` and `speaker_orgs` as listed on the page; `tags: [women-advancing-river-research]`; `published: true`; `description` one factual sentence (see judgment calls). No transcript flag, no speaker emails.
- **One by hand (rule: more than ten items):** the first, a middle and the last of the 63 are in the "Example files" section; the generator is `agent/audit/warr-build.mjs` (it reads the snapshot and writes the files; `--preview` shows three, `--write` writes all).

### Agent's judgment calls (C7), each yours to change

1. **`description`** is required by the schema and the page gives none. I wrote one sentence from the facts only: "A Women Advancing River Research webinar on February 25, 2021, with Berit Arheimer (Swedish Meteorological & Hydrological Institute)." The alternative is to leave these items out until someone writes real descriptions, or to make `description` optional (a schema change, its own code PR).
2. **Two spelling fixes to the legacy page's text:** "llison Pfeiffer" to **Allison Pfeiffer** (22 September 2022; a geologist at Western Washington University, checked against the department's page) and "The Nature Conservatory" to **The Nature Conservancy** (19 September 2024). Both are in the CSV; if you would rather keep the source's spelling, say so.
3. **One title differs from YouTube's** (17 March 2022): the page says "The Hard Science of “Soft” Geomorphology: Flow Vegetation Organic Carbon Feedback in Rivers & Floodplains"; YouTube holds "…Flow Vegetation-Organic-Carbon in Rivers & Floodplains". I used the page's title, as for the other 62.
4. **Series name and tag:** one series chip, "Women Advancing River Research (WARR)", and one tag. The page adds a series chip and a tag chip, and the list grows from 21 published cards to 84.
5. **No pagination:** `/learn-train/cyberseminars` renders every published item as a card, so 84 cards with a thumbnail each; whether that is acceptable on a phone needs a human look on the deploy preview.

### To verify (C3; not guessed)

- Allison Pfeiffer and The Nature Conservancy (above), by someone who knows the lecture.
- That the 63 lecture dates are the lecture dates and not the date the videos were published: the legacy pages give the lecture date; the channel's feed shows 11 of the videos published on 19 October 2026, so the upload date is not the lecture date, and the pages' dates were used.
- The 2026 page lists 8 lectures with videos. The WARR session announced for 19 November 2026 has no video yet and is not included.
- **Two more misspellings copied from the legacy page** (found by the reviewer; not fixed, because only two fixes were approved): "Pacific Northwestern National Laboratory" (2025, probably Pacific Northwest National Laboratory) and "Vrije University of Amsterdam" (2026, the institution is usually written Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam). Kept as the source has them; say if you want them fixed.
- Whether `Tulane University, U.S.` (the page's wording for one speaker's institution) should lose the ", U.S."; kept as the source has it.

## Part 2. Two existing unpublished items with malformed video ids (change)

`nav-beyond-academic-ai-2025` (`GMeAjRTsM`, 9 characters) and `nav-beyond-academic-broader-impacts-2025` (`Y483oWkQ`, 8): both ids cannot be real (YouTube ids have 11). Proposal: set `youtube_id` to an empty string in both (the schema allows empty and the card then has no embed); they stay `published: false`; the right ids go in when the channel list is in. 2 files, one line each. Alternative: leave them until the Studio export arrives.

## Part 3. Two published items whose videos have no public thumbnail (decision)

`intro-compute-services-july-2024` (`h3Lsyc8duHI`) and `intro-hydroshare-may-2024` (`0sJVFohvhBQ`): oEmbed did not answer 200 and the thumbnail answers 404 (A3g, finding 4). Options: **(a)** leave both as they are until someone with channel access says whether the videos are private, deleted or embed-disabled (recommended; nothing visible changes); **(b)** set `youtube_id` empty so each card shows as text with no broken picture; **(c)** unpublish both (`published: false`). I recommend (a), then (b) if the channel check takes more than a week.

## Not in this proposal (code, separate PRs, each with its reason)

- A check that `youtube_id` is empty or 11 characters from `A-Z a-z 0-9 _ -` in `scripts/content-schemas.mjs`. It must follow Part 2, or the validator would fail on the two malformed ids (C1).
- The page's hero says "350+ free recordings on water science"; the site publishes 21 items today (84 with this batch) and the legacy site claims "over 150". Which number is true needs the channel's list (A3g, "What I need"). The claim is in `pages/learn-train/cyberseminars/index.vue`, which is code, so it is a separate PR, and it is unchanged here.

## Example files

The first, a middle and the last file the generator would write are in `agent/audit/warr-example-files.md` (printed with `--preview`).

## Decision and result (added 6 November 2026, after Jordan's reply)

Jordan approved Parts 1 and 2 and chose option (c) for Part 3 (unpublish both). Applied: 63 files added, `youtube_id` emptied in the two malformed items, `published: false` in `intro-compute-services-july-2024` and `intro-hydroshare-may-2024`. Correction to this proposal: the page lists **82** published cards (21 - 2 + 63), not 84; checked in the built page (82 thumbnails, 64 mentions of the series name: 63 cards and the filter chip). `verify.sh --build`: 0 FAIL; the validator passes on 88 cyberseminar files.

Slugs and descriptions were refined before anything was applied (reviewer, cosmetic): the slug keeps words of 2 letters ("de-icer") and takes up to 6 words without ending on a preposition; a description with three or more speakers reads "A (x), B (y) and C (z)". The table above is the final set.

## Update, 6 November 2026: two more spelling fixes

Jordan approved fixing the two misspellings listed above ("Yes, fix the typos"). Agent's choice of wording (C7): "Pacific Northwestern National Laboratory" became **Pacific Northwest National Laboratory** (lecture of 16 January 2025) and "Vrije University of Amsterdam" became **Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam**, the university's own name (lecture of 21 May 2026). Each is in one file (a `speaker_orgs` entry and the description). The generator's fix list (`agent/audit/warr-build.mjs`), the proposal CSV and the numbers file now carry the same four fixes.

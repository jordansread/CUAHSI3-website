# Critical Zone legacy sites: retirement checklist and the part of the dry run that can be done now (T16)

31 October 2026. Epic CUAHSI/CUAHSI3-website#62, ticket T16. A checklist and a partial dry run; **nothing is redirected, changed or configured**. Build: `main` at `d231e2f`. Facts about the hosts are in `261031_cz-golive-approvals.md` (section A); the redirect map is `261031_cz-redirect-map.md`. The steps that need an account or your approval are marked **[you]**.

## Dry run: what I could check without access

| Check | Result | How |
|---|---|---|
| Every section-level target in the redirect map exists in the build | 10 of 10 observatory pages, the front page, about, datasets, papers and network pages: all present | file exists in `.output/public/critical-zone-science/...` |
| Every `#cluster-...` anchor the map relies on exists on the network page | 10 of 10 (`hub`, `bedrock`, `dust2`, `bigdata`, `dynamic-water`, `cinet`, `drylands`, `coastal`, `urban`, `geomicrobiology`) | the `id` attribute is in the built HTML |
| The legacy path groups in the map still answer | archive: 11 of 12 paths answer 200 (`shale-hills`, `sierra`, `calhoun`, `luquillo`, `catalina-jemez`, `boulder`, `christina`, `iml`, `reynolds`, `eel`, `national`); `/jemez-catalina` answers 404. CZNet: 15 of 17 answer 200 (the ten clusters, `publications`, `data`, `about`, `people`, `news-events`); `/people-roles` and `/nsfczo` answer 404 | `curl`, following redirects, 31 October 2026 |
| The home pages hold no path group that the map lacks | none on either site (archive: only `/assets`, `/stylesheets`, `/favicon.ico`; CZNet: nothing outside the 25 groups of the inventory) | links on each home page against the T1 inventory |

The three paths that answer 404 are `/jemez-catalina` (the map calls it a stray path), `/nsfczo` (the map notes that its page answered 404 in T1) and `/people-roles` (not noted before). The map sends all three somewhere in the section; a redirect from a dead path is harmless.

What this does **not** show: that a redirect works (none exists), that Netlify keeps a `#fragment` through a redirect (to test, not assume), and anything about Discover's paths (not requested).

Two facts for the cutover, from the live hosts: the archive's own `sitemap.xml` answers with a Google Cloud Storage `NoSuchKey` error, so the archive is a static bucket with no sitemap; `criticalzone.org` has none either (a "Page not found"). So the inventory (T1, 10,671 URLs) is the only list of what exists.

## The checklist

Before anything is switched off, in this order.

1. **Snapshot refresh [you decide, I run]** (T16 item 1, and decision 9 in the approvals report). Re-crawl both sites and Discover, deposit the archive with a DOI, link it from the finding aid. Discover is a JavaScript app, so it needs a browser crawl; this is the riskiest step to leave late. Done when: the crawl is compared with T1 (counts by section) and the deposit has a DOI.
2. **Final re-crawl for new pages.** Compare against T1 and add any new path group to the map. The home-page check above found none today; repeat it at the time.
3. **Decisions 1 to 4 confirmed [you]** (redirect targets for `national`, `/people*`, `/news-events`, Discover).
4. **Site address set, sitemap and canonical links** (T7b, rule 8 **[you]**), so the new pages can be found when the old ones go.
5. **Redirect tooling** (code PR, rule 8 **[you]**): host-aware rules in the generator and the checker, tested with the existing redirect check. Done when: the checker passes with host rules, and a test lists each map row and its target.
6. **Name the DNS owner [you]:** the GoDaddy account for `criticalzone.org`, and the administrator of the Google Cloud project behind the archive and Discover (approvals report, section A).
7. **Cutover order.** (a) `criticalzone.org`, already on Netlify, first: add it as a domain alias of this site and publish the host rules. (b) Archive. (c) Discover and its API host `contribute.criticalzone.org`: **do not redirect the API host before checking what still calls it** (I did not look into what calls it). Test each step before the next.
8. **After each step:** request every row of the redirect map from the live host and compare with the target; 200 on the target, one redirect hop, no loop. Done when: 0 of N failing, with N stated.
9. **Keep the redirects.** Retirement is of the old sites, not of their addresses; do not let the domains lapse.
10. **T17 (after go-live):** page-level redirects for the most-visited pages (publication pages to their DOIs), chosen from real traffic.

## Not checked

Discover's own paths. Whether any other service calls `contribute.criticalzone.org`. Who runs the Google Cloud project. Whether the three legacy hosts have traffic worth planning around (no analytics access). Redirect behaviour with query strings and trailing slashes.
